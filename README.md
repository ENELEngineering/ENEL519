# Timer Project 3
This branch contains the source code that satisfies the requirements presented
for driver project #3 concerning timers.

# Deliverables
* Create functions: void delay_sec(time_sec) in C-source file Timer.C and Timer.h
* Takes in user-input time delay values in seconds time_sec as 32 bit number and
uses timer 2/3 to produce delay.
* When called in main(), it should be used to produce delays of between 1 sec
and 3 days (How many seconds is that??).
* Verify the smallest time delay generated by your functions in. Get it checked
off by instructor.
* Verify if time delay of 10-15 mins is generated by your function (Get it 
checked off by instructor).
* **Final code on dropbox and demo during class. Due date as per D2L dropbox**
