# Driver Project 5
This branch contains the source code that satisfies the requirements presented
for driver project #5 concerning ADC functionalities.

# Deliverables
* Create function: unsigned int do_ADC(void) in C-source file ADC.c and ADC.h
* Uses internal clock and PIC supply voltage.
* When called in main(), it should be used to perform 10 bit ADC on potentiometer
connected to pin RA3/AN5 (pin 8) once every second.
* It should display 10 bit ADC value in binary or Hex form using a bar graph display
and value at the end of the bar graph on the terminal.
