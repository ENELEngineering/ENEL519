# Timer Project 2
This branch contains the source code that satisfies the requirements presented
for driver project #2 concerning timers.

# Deliverables
* Create functions: void delay_ms(time_ms, idle_on) and void delay_us(time_us, idle_on) in C-source file Timer.C and Timer.h
* Takes in time values time_ms in msec and time_us in microsec as 16 bit numbers and uses
timer 2 to produce a delay.
* When called in main(), it should be used to produce delays of 1 sec and 50 usec.
* Verify the smallest time delay generated by your functions in msec and usec. Get it checked off by instructor.
* Due date: 1 week from Project assignment.
