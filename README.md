# Driver Project 1
This branch contains the source code that satisfies the requirements presented
for driver project #1 concerning UART displays.

# Deliverables
* Write a function that:
    - Displays the IO port(s) connected to the push buttons displayed when one or more
    push buttons are pressed.
    - For instance terminal window display should show the following when the corresponding push buttons are pressed.
        * RA2, RB4, and RA4 pressed.
        * RA2 pressed.
        * RB4 and RA4 pressed.
        * No presses.
    - Blinks the LED every 500 ms when a push button is pressed. Use basic while/for loops for now. We will cover Timers in a subsequent lecture/lab.
